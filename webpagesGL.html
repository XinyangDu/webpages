        <!--A paragraph about my self -->
        <p>Hello, my name is Xinyang Du, you can also call me Peter.
           I come from Qingdao-China, which has the same latitude as Raleigh.
           I am a student in Computer Science major.
           I think the biggest reason I am going to study Computer Science is that the majority of my family members are masters of computer, and they also believes computer is the future of the world, but I am actually not good at computer for now, so I still have a lot need to study.
